ECG200:

This dataset was formatted by R. Olszewski as part of his thesis "Generalized feature extraction for structural pattern recognition in time-series data" at Carnegie Mellon University, 2001. Each series traces the electrical activity recorded during one heartbeat. The two classes are a normal heartbeat and a Myocardial Infarction.
